<p>Does your organization build web and mobile applications for your customers, clients and/or employees? Do you want to get those applications out into their hands quicker and with less maintainability from your already over-worked IT staff? Knowing and understanding what the Open Data Protocol (OData) can bring to your enterprise will allow you to build one data platform for all aspects of your IT needs. It will open up a new way to look at your data that you may not have thought possible.</p>
<p>Interested in OData? Want to discover what the next revolution in data will be? In this workshop, the attendee is invited to consider the many opportunities and challenges for data-intensive applications, inter-organizational data sharing for “data mashups,” the establishment of new processes and pipelines, and an agenda to exploit the opportunities as well as stay ahead of the data deluge.</p>
<p>The Open Data Protocol (OData) is a Web protocol for querying and updating data which provides a way to unlock your data and free it from silos that exist in applications today. OData does this by applying and building upon Web technologies such as HTTP, Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub) and JSON to provide access to information from a variety of applications, services, and stores.</p>
<p>OData is consistent with the way the Web works – it makes a deep commitment to URIs for resource identification and commits to an HTTP-based, uniform interface for interacting with those resources (just like the Web). This commitment to core Web principles allows OData to enable a new level of data integration and interoperability across a broad range of clients, servers, services, and tools.</p>
<p>The protocol emerged from experiences implementing AtomPub clients and servers in a variety of products over the past several years. OData is being used to expose and access information from a variety of sources including, but not limited to, relational databases, file systems, content management systems and traditional Web sites.</p>
<p>In this workshop Chris Woodruff of Woodruff Solutions LLC will go further and give hands on learning that will prepare the attendee when they leave the 2 day OData event.</p>
